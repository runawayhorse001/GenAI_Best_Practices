About this book
---------------

This is the book for our Generative AI: Best practics [GenAI]_.
The PDF version can be downloaded from `HERE <../latex/GenAI.pdf>`_. 
**You may download and distribute it. Please beaware,
however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description.**

In this book, we aim to demonstrate best practices for Generative AI 
through detailed demo code and practical examples. For each chapter, we provide detailed 
Colab notebooks |Colab| that you can open and run directly in Google Colab.
